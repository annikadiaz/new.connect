# Welcome!

My name is Annika and I am currently learning Swift and the basics of app development and design. 

I am looking forward to [sharing my progress](ViewMyWork.md) here and am open to suggestions and advice on ways to improve my skills!

## Current and Upcoming Projects: [View My Portfolio Here](ViewMyWork.md)
- In an effort to foster connections between students during, and coming off of, the pandemic, I developed a [website](https://u.osu.edu/asconnect/) to help connect students. 
- In order to make the goal of website more accessible and user friendly for students, I am working to learn Swift and develop an app that will accomplish this goal!
